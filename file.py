# Create a Python file named lab_2-3.py

# Set a equal to 2. Using the type() function, print the type of variable a

# Change the type of a to a float using a = float(a). What is the result of printing type(a) now?

# Convert a to a string. Check its type with a print statement. What has changed?

# Convert a to a Boolean. Print the result of a == 2. What is the result? Why? (Answer as a comment)
